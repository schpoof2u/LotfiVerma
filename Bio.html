        <h2>About us</h2>
        <h3>Ali Lotfi</h3><!--Insert a picture of Ali-->
        <p>My name is Ali Lotfi and one of my passions as a kid was to create. Creating games, websites, robots, and a lot more. Computers have also been one of my passions as a kid, I wanted to know how things work and how human interaction affects them. Some accomplishments of mine are; that I mentored Elementary school kids in a High School program called BoroBuddies, which was simply teaching them helpful study hacks to make their academic life easier. I learned plenty of programming languages and used them to make projects like; creating tech-based quizzes for teenagers using python, and creating a prototype webpage that had informational texts about marine life using HTML and CSS.</p>
        <h3>Shikhar Verma</h3><!--Insert a picture of Shikhar-->
        <p>My name is Shikhar Verma and I am your ordinary guy. Some accomplishments of mine are making an English to wingdings translator in java(it’s spaghetti code but I’m proud of it). I made a simple website about architecture, wrote a seven-page research paper for school about traffic and public transportation(it’s got grammar mistakes), and I’m in varsity debate for Hillsborough High School. Passions of mine include coding when I can, learning about unique subjects, learning about tech on every level, software, hardware, and ethics. I like math despite some hardships with geometry. Overall, I would say I’m an ordinary guy who just wants to do things that they enjoy.</p>
