        <h1>Intro to Chemistry</h1>
        <p>What is chemistry? Chemistry is the study of matter 
            (anything that takes up space and has mass) and how it is affected/changed. 
            Even though many people don’t notice, chemistry is all around us. 
            The things we can see, hear, touch, smell, and taste, occurs with chemicals, 
            which are matter. Chemistry can be observed in everyday life, such as cleaning detergents, 
            disinfectants, soaps, drugs, vitamins, supplements, pollutants, modern food, light bulbs, 
            electronics, vehicles, etc. 
        </p>
        <h2>Types of Chemistry</h2>
        <p>Now, in chemistry, there are different disciplines/branches. 
            The following are,</p>
           <dl>
            <dt>Orrganic Chemistry:</dt>
            <dd>The study of carbon-containing compounds in both living and nonliving things. </dd>

            <dt>Inorganic Chemistry:</dt>
            <dd>The study of non-carbon based compounds.</dd>

            <dt>Biochemistry:</dt>
            <dd>The study of chemical reactions/processes that occur inside of organisms.</dd>

            <dt>Phyiscal Chemistry:</dt>
            <dd>The study of chemical systems that apply to concepts of physics. </dd>

            <dt>Nuclear Chemistry</dt>
            <dd>The study of chemical changes that occur in the nucleus (center) of an atom. </dd>
           </dl>
           <h2>The Scientific Process</h2>
           <p>There is a method which scientists use, 
            to create explanations and create conclusions about any questions they have. 
            This is called the <strong>Scientific Process</strong>, and it can occur in two ways. 
            One of these ways is called the <strong>Scientific Inquiry</strong>, 
            which is when scientists utilize a step-by-step method to find the solution to a question. 
            It begins with a question/problem. 
            Then, the scientist will try to collect as much information that is involved 
            with the investigation by doing some background research. 
            This research consists of making observations, and experimenting. 
            The Scientific Method   consists of 7 steps. </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Ask a question/identify the issue</li>
                <li>Conduct the background research</li>
                <li>Create a hypothesis</li>
                <li>Test the found hypothesis with experiments</li>
                <li>While the experiment is ongoing, make observations and collect data</li>
                <li>Analyze the results and draw conclusions*</li>
                <li>Share results!</li>
                <p>* If Error Occurs: Change the variable and start over from the hypothesis step</p>
            </ol>
            <p>The scientific process however, isn’t always going to develop a clear answer. 
                Scientists can often find themselves going back to similar or even the same questions 
                again and again. To conduct investigations, scientists can use different types of sciences 
                such as Pure Science and Applied Science. </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Pure Science</dt>
                    <dd>The usage of theories and predictions to learn more about nature and its properties. 
                        For example: Geology.</dd>
                    <img src="Images/Screenshot from 2022-07-16 18-39-49.png">

                    <dt>Applied Science</dt>
                    <dd>The usage of knowledge to develop technology and doing engineering work. 
                        For example: Vehicles or the development of rockets. 
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <h2>Models</h2>
                <p>Scientists also use models which represent certain situations using another 
                    vector to display it. These models can easily allow scientists to observe 
                    and gather data. Different types of models include the Physical Model, 
                    Computer Model, and Mathematical Model. 
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Physical Model</dt>
                    <dd>A model that can be built, such as a molecule that is represented by 
                        marshmallows, gumdrops, and sticks.</dd>
                    <img src="Images/marshmallow_2.jpg">
                    <dt>Computer Model</dt>
                    <dd>A simulation generated by a computer to represent chemical reactions or objects in motion. </dd>
                    <dt>Mathematical Model</dt>
                    <dd>Calculations that involve a certain mathematical equation, such as the equation of a line.</dd>
                </dl>
                <h2>Scientific Theories and Laws</h2>
                <p>After many experiments are completed and models are developed, 
                    scientists can use those to make ideas to explain how and why these things occur. 
                    An idea starts as a hypothesis that hasn’t been proven to be false or true. 
                    A theory is only developed after a hypothesis has been proven through tests 
                    or experiments.</p>
                        <h3>Theory</h3>
                        <p> An explanation that was proposed based on examined facts. 
                            These theories can either be rejected, or they can be proven. 
                            However, they can be changed and improved upon as/if more facts are found.
                             For scientific knowledge theories are required since they are a way of 
                             collecting facts and putting them to use.</p>
                        <h3>Scientific Law</h3>
                        <p>Scientific Laws describe what occurs in nature. 
                            Simply put, laws in science are rules that are based on 
                            observation of processes that occur naturally and behave 
                            the same way every time. An example of a law is the Law of Conservation of Mass.
                             This was discovered in 1774, by Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier. 
                             This law states that matter is neither created nor destroyed, 
                             but rearranged during a chemical reaction. 
                             The difference between a law and a theory is that, 
                             a law does describe WHAT happens, 
                             while a theory does describe WHY it happens.  </p>
